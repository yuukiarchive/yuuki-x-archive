Solution
let P be the perimeter of each shape.
the area of each shape is:
‚Ä¢ circle: P¬≤/4œÄ
‚Ä¢ equilateral triangle: ‚àö3 P¬≤/36
‚Ä¢ square: P¬≤/16
so the ""area outside the shapes"" is the largest. it's infinite. https://twitter.com/yuuki26/status/1771774122164453821 https://twitter.com/yuuki26/status/1771796115479749078/photo/1"
